____&___

The objective of this project is to build a web-based application that automates QA test execution by integrating with Jira and aTest. The application will allow users to enter a Jira ID or aTest Test Run ID, after which the system will automatically fetch the associated test cases and interpret their steps using an Al- driven browser automation engine. The automation will execute the test steps in a real browser, and the live execution - including logs, step status, and periodic screenshots- will be streamed back to the Ul so the QA team can monitor the process in real time. After execution is complete, the system will update the test status in Jira and gTest and upload all relevant artifacts such as screenshots, logs, and reports. The platform will also maintain a detailed execution history page where users can review past runs, view step-by-step details, and download results in ZIP or PDF format.
The application will include an admin configuration module where users can securely store Jira and qTest credentials, access tokens, and target application login details. All sensitive information will be masked and stored with encryption. A background automation engine will continuously monitor Jira and gTest for newly created QA tasks and automatically trigger execution whenever new test runs appear. Additionally, the system will send email notifications to the QA team summarizing the results of every automated run. The solution will include role-based access (Admin and QA roles), and will be designed with scalability, auditability, and ease of use in mind. The complete delivery is planned within 35 working days, assuming parallel development between frontend and backend, with QA validation and a small buffer period included for stabilization and user acceptance testing
